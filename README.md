## Description
For this assignment I had to build a CMS-style blog, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. The site includes a log in and sign up page where a user can input their information securely. Once a user logs in, they can read posts and comment on them. There is also a dashboard button which displays the logged in user's past post.
